# Project-Employee-BurnOut-Analysis
# Employee Burnout Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict employee burnout using machine learning techniques. Burnout, which encompasses physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion, can severely impact productivity and employee well-being. By analyzing factors like workload, mental fatigue, and work-life balance, this project develops a predictive model to identify employees at risk of burnout, enabling organizations to take proactive measures.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following key features:

- **Employee ID**: Unique identifier for each employee.
- **Date of Joining**: The date when the employee joined the company.
- **Company Type**: Whether the company is service-based or product-based.
- **Work-from-Home Setup**: Indicates if the employee has work-from-home facilities (Yes/No).
- **Designation**: Employee’s role, scaled from 0 to 5.
- **Resource Allocation**: Work hours per day, ranging from 1 to 10.
- **Mental Fatigue Score**: A measure of the employee's mental stress level, from 0 to 10.
- **Burn Rate**: The target variable indicating the extent of burnout, on a scale of 0 to 1.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
- Handle missing values.
- Perform feature scaling and encode categorical variables.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyze key patterns and correlations within the data.
- Visualize trends and distributions of various features.

### 3. Model Development:
- Implement a **Linear Regression** model to predict the burn rate.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - R-squared (R²)

### 4. Insights & Results:
- Key contributors to burnout are identified, helping organizations take proactive action.
- The model highlights the significance of mental fatigue and resource allocation in predicting burnout.
- Work-from-home availability has a notable impact on burnout levels.

## Key Findings

- Employees with higher mental fatigue scores and greater resource allocation are more prone to burnout.
- Work-from-home availability significantly impacts burnout levels.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate **real-time data** to enable dynamic predictions.
- Explore **advanced machine learning models** (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for improved accuracy.
- Scale the model for use across different industries.
