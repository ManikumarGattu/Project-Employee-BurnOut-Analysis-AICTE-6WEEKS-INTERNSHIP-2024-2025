# Project-Employee-BurnOut-Analysis
This project focuses on predicting employee burnout using machine learning techniques. Employee burnout, characterized by physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion, can significantly affect productivity and well-being. By analyzing relevant factors such as workload, mental fatigue, and work-life balance, we develop a predictive model to identify at-risk employees and help organizations take proactive measures.

Dataset
The dataset contains key features like:

Employee ID: Unique identifier for each employee.
Date of Joining: Employee joining date.
Company Type: Service or Product-based company.
Work-from-Home Setup: Availability of WFH facilities.
Designation: Employee role, on a scale of 0 to 5.
Resource Allocation: Work hours, ranging from 1 to 10.
Mental Fatigue Score: Mental stress level, from 0 to 10.
Burn Rate: Target variable indicating the extent of burnout (0 to 1).
Implementation Steps
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.
Perform feature scaling and encoding for categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze key patterns and correlations in the data.
Visualize trends and distribution of features.
Model Development:

Implement a Linear Regression model to predict the burn rate.
Evaluate performance using metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
Insights & Results:

The model highlights key contributors to burnout, aiding proactive intervention.
Key Findings
Employees with higher mental fatigue scores and resource allocation are more prone to burnout.
Work-from-home availability showed a significant impact on burnout levels.
Future Enhancements
Incorporate real-time data for dynamic prediction.
Explore advanced machine learning models to improve accuracy.
Scale the model for use in various industries.
